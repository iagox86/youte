Okay, so, I don't know what the heck just happened.

We finally decided to follow Dezri's anti-compass, and came to an alley that I'd heard rumours about.

I'm just gonna write this down quickly, because I'm not sure this actually happened.

We fought a weird goat thing (somebody called it a "krampus"?), did a little quest for a red-nosed reindeer, stole from a fat guy in a red suit, and solved some puzzle involving a bunch of giant candles.

At one point gravity turned off and we almost hit the ceiling. At another, we were fighting little snowmen in a room full of traps.

We got some cool items (a lantern that reveals invisible beings, a weird unicorn statue that talks), and we got to use the Immovable Rod, which was cool.

I'm hoping we wake up tomorrow and none of this happened.
