Fuck.

Nihilor told us his backstory. It's kinda tragic. I felt bad for him.

We engaged Nihilor. There was madness. There were tentacles. I was fighting an Intellect Devourer, doing a shitty job because I was alone in combat and couldn't get a sneak attack.

I feel a mental blast. It singes my brain.

When the dust settles and Nihilor is dead, we found Vaeris. Dead.

What's the point of this bullshit?

I don't even know why we're doing it.

Now my friend's gone.

Ugh.
