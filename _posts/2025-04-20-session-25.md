I knew it! When I woke up in the morning, Vaeris is fine!

Dezri ran and fetched Holga, who nearly smote Vaeris. But Vaeris admitted that his patron Strahd let him come back to life in exchange for agreeing to fight Asmodeus, which sounds like a good deal to me!

Me and Vaeris stuck around the house

Dezri and Nerali went off to give Jarlaxle the first eye. They tried to nest it into the Stone, and I get the vibe that something happened but they won't say

Tala and Aethrex went off to The Blackstaff to let her know what's going on. She was pleased and give us some rewards, and told us that we're invited to dinner with Laerel (the Open Lord)! Oh boy, royalty!!

Back home, we talked a bunch. I don't remember what about. Probably Vaeris.
